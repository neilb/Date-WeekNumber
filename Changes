Revision history for Perl module Date::WeekNumber

0.02 2014-03-06
    - POSIX::strftime() doesn't handle %G or %V on Windows. Sigh.
      We now use strftime() for cpan_week_number() and Date::Calc()
      for iso_week_number().
    - Added Date::ISO8601 and Date::ISO to SEE ALSO

0.01 2014-03-03
    - First release to CPAN
